Smart File Assistant – AI Document Q&A System

Developed as part of Internship / AI Project
Author: Nihal Rao

📖 Project Overview

Smart File Assistant is an AI-powered document analysis system that allows users to ask questions about PDF documents and receive intelligent answers.

The system processes PDF files, extracts text, converts the content into semantic embeddings, and stores them in a vector database. When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant document sections and uses a language model to generate an accurate response.

This project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be applied to build an intelligent document assistant.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a system that can:

• Extract and process text from documents
• Convert document content into semantic embeddings
• Store embeddings in a vector database for fast retrieval
• Perform semantic search on documents
• Generate AI-powered answers based on document content

This enables users to interact with documents using natural language queries.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python

Sentence Transformers
FAISS (Vector Database)
OpenAI API / LLM
PyPDF / PyMuPDF
NumPy
Visual Studio Code
GitHub

Key libraries used:

• sentence-transformers
• FAISS

✅ Milestone 1 – Document Processing

Tasks Completed

• Extracted text from PDF documents
• Implemented text cleaning and preprocessing
• Removed unwanted characters and formatting
• Structured the extracted text for further processing

Output

Clean document text ready for chunking and embedding.

✅ Milestone 2 – Chunking & Embedding Generation

Step 1: Text Chunking

Large documents were divided into smaller chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

Example:

Document Text
→ Chunk 1
→ Chunk 2
→ Chunk 3

This allows the system to search specific sections of a document rather than the entire file.

Step 2: Embedding Generation

Text chunks were converted into vector embeddings using the model:

all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Embeddings represent semantic meaning, enabling the system to find similar content even if exact keywords are not present.

Example

User Query:
"device is not starting"

Matching document content:

"system fails to boot"

✅ Milestone 3 – Semantic Search & RAG Pipeline

Objective

Enable intelligent document search and answer generation using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

Step 1: Vector Database

Embeddings were stored using FAISS for efficient similarity search.

Generated Files

vector_index.faiss
chunks.pkl

Purpose

File | Description
vector_index.faiss | Stores vector embeddings
chunks.pkl | Stores document text chunks

Step 2: Semantic Search

User queries are converted into embeddings and compared against the FAISS index.

Example Query

"How do I troubleshoot system startup issues?"

The system retrieves document sections discussing:

• boot failures
• system errors
• startup troubleshooting

even if exact keywords do not match.

Step 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieved document chunks are passed to the language model as context.

Example Interaction

User Query

"What is the main topic of the document?"

System Process

Convert query into embedding

Search FAISS index

Retrieve relevant document chunks

Provide context to the LLM

Generated Response

The system produces a summarized answer based on the relevant document content.
